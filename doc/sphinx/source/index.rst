A tool for modeling and fitting multiwvelength SEDs of relativistic jets
------------------------------------------------------------------------

:Author: `Andrea Tramacere <www.www.www>`_


This page provides a user guide to the JetSeT tool. This tool consists of a web interface and of
an accurate code to reproduce radiative and accelerative process acting in the jet of Blazars. The current version
of the web interface does not allow to perform temporal evolutions with cooling and/or acceleration processes.
This web interface allows the user to reproduce snapshot of the balazar emission, according to a specific electron energy
distribution and to other physical parameters, that can be specified in the left frame of the SED tool.

The numerical code used in this tool reproduces both synchrotron and Inverse Compton processes. Both the web interface and the
numerical code have been developed by Andrea Tramacere. The numerical code has been used in several refereed publications,
If you use this code in any kind of scientific publication you shall cite the following papers:
