1) get a token: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2) save tocken to a file
3) travis encrypt tockenfile

5) add the tocken to the travis website, going to the setting of
   the project and add the api_key env variable, putting as value the github generated tocken

6) add the secure to the .travis.yml (this method did not work see here :https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/9610)
